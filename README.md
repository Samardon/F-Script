##F-Script

F-Script is a set of open source tools for dynamic introspection, manipulation and scripting of Cocoa objects on Mac OS X.


##Build

F-Script heavily depends on frameworks available in the system. There is a scheme for each release of Mac OS X:

- 10.7
- 10.8
- 10.9
- 10.10

Each scheme consists of app and frameworks that a linked against all relevent frameworks available in the system.
I *highly* suggest you to use app that is specifically build for you version of Mac OS X.


##Paid Support
If functional you need is missing but you're ready to pay for it, feel free to contact me. If not, create an issue anyway, I'll take a look as soon as I can.
